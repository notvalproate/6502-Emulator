# 6502 Emulator

### A simple and (hopefully) readable 6502 Core Emulator.

It passes the functional and decimal tests from [Klaus Dormann's Test Suite](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests). Yet to test the interrupt test, and no plans to turn this into a 65C02 for the extended op codes test.
